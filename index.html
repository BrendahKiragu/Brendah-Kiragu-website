        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          My coding journey started at Moringa School bootcamp. While there I
          got hands on experience building projects each week to apply the
          week's content. I have built projects with HTML, CSS, React, and APIs
          with FLask.

        <br />
        <p>
          I have experience working on individual projects and group tasks. My
          favorite quote which is also my I can do it line is "Add YET at the
          end of any I can't statement."

        My process ensures that we create a website tailored to your business
        needs.
      </p>

        <p>DO WE MATCH?</p>
        <img src="./images/step1.jpg" alt="brainstorming session" />
        <h3>DISCOVERY CALL</h3>
        <p>
          Before we start, we determine if and how I can help you.<br />
          What are your <u>requirements</u> for your new website?<br />
          Why do you need a new website? What <u>goals</u> do you have.
          <br />What <u>problems</u> can we solve with a new website?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process" id="step2">
        <p>WE NEED A PLAN</p>
        <img src="./images/planning.jpg" alt="sticky notes with ideas written" />
        <h3>CONCEPT & STRATEGY</h3>
        <p>
          Together, we develop a strategy that successfully combines your goals
          with the needs of your target audience. Based on this concept, I
          create the first wireframes and an interactive prototype. This
          provides us with a very good impression of the website and the user
          interface.

        <h3>WEB DESIGN</h3>
        <p>
          Now comes the magic. Based on the previously developed concept, I
          create a high-end screen design perfectly tailored to your brand. A
          web design that sets you apart from your competition, fits your target
          audience ideally, and provides an excellent user experience.

        <img src="./images/landing page.jpg" alt="a website landing page">
        <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <p>
          In this step, we breathe life into your new high-end design. You will
          receive a custom-built website using a modular web design system and
          CMS integration. Animations will add the necessary flair to your site
          and set you apart from the boring competition.

        <h3>WEBSITE ONBOARDING</h3>
        <p>
          In a personal Framer workshop, I will show you how to make changes to
          your new website quickly and easily. Additionally, you will receive
          personalized Framer video tutorials that you can access at any time.
          Edit your Framer website without a complicated backend or the need for
          an additional programmer. It's as simple as that.
