        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          My coding journey started at Moringa School bootcamp. While there I
          got hands on experience building projects each week to apply the
          week's content. I have built projects with HTML, CSS, React, and APIs
          with FLask.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have experience working on individual projects and group tasks. My
          favorite quote which is also my I can do it line is "Add YET at the
          end of any I can't statement."

        <p>DO WE MATCH?</p>
        <img src="./images/step1.jpg" alt="brainstorming session" />
        <h3>DISCOVERY CALL</h3>
        <p>Before we start, we determine if and how I can help you.</p>
        <p>What are your <u>requirements</u> for your new website?</p>
        <p>Why do you need a new website? What <u>goals</u> do you have.</p>
        <p>What <u>problems</u> can we solve with a new website?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="process" id="step2">
        <p>WE NEED A PLAN</p>
        <img
          src="./images/planning.jpg"
          alt="sticky notes with ideas written"
        />
        <h3>CONCEPT & STRATEGY</h3>
        <p>
          Together, we develop a strategy that successfully combines your goals
          with the needs of your target audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on this concept, I create the first wireframes and an
          interactive prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          This provides us with a very good impression of the website and the
          user interface.

        <h3>WEB DESIGN</h3>
        <p>Now comes the magic.</p>
        <p>
          Based on the previously developed concept, I create a high-end screen
          design perfectly tailored to your brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          A web design that sets you apart from your competition, fits your
          target audience ideally, and provides an excellent user experience.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/landing page.jpg" alt="a website landing page" />
        <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <p>In this step, we breathe life into your new high-end design.</p>
        <p>
          You will receive a custom-built website using a modular web design
          system and CMS integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Animations will add the necessary flair to your site and set you apart
          from the boring competition.

          additional programmerâ€”it's as simple as that!
