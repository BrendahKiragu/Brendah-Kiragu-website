          <p>My coding journey started at Moringa School bootcamp. While there
            I got hands on experience building projects each week to apply the 
            week's content. I have built projects with HTML, CSS, React, and APIs with FLask.
          </p> <br>
          <p>I have experience working on individual projects and group tasks.
            My favorite quote which is also my I can do it line is "Add YET at the end of
            any I can't statement."

        Your Website <br />

        Our process ensures that we create a website tailored to your business
        needs.

        <p>DO WE MATCH?</p>
        <h3>DISCOVERY CALL</h3>
        <p>
          Before we start, we determine if and how I can help you. What are your
          requirements for your new website? Why do you need a new website? What
          goals do you have, and what problems can we solve with a new website?
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, we develop a strategy that successfully combines your goals
          with the needs of your target audience. Based on this concept, I
          create the first wireframes and an interactive prototype. This
          provides us with a very good impression of the website and the user
          interface.

        <h3>WEB DESIGN</h3>
        <p>
          Now comes the magic. Based on the previously developed concept, I
          create a high-end screen design perfectly tailored to your brand. A
          web design that sets you apart from your competition, fits your target
          audience ideally, and provides an excellent user experience.

          receive a custom-built website using a modular web design system and
          CMS integration. Animations will add the necessary flair to your site
          and set you apart from the boring competition.
